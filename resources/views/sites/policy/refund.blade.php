                            <p><strong>Exchanges</strong><br />
                                We have a 30 day exchange policy. The 30 days starts the day the shirt is delivered to you, based on the USPS tracking. The shirt must be back to us by the 30th day.</p>
                            <p>Exchanges are accepted for the following reasons:</p>
                            <p>The size didn’t work for you<br />
                                You want a different color<br />
                                You want a different design<br />
                                *Please note that there are no exchanges accepted on custom items, clearance shirts or imperfection sales.</p>
                            <p>We only allow exchanges on items that are new and have not been worn or washed.</p>
                            <p>Please email us (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6b181e1b1b04191f2b2c040a1f181f0e0e45080406">[email&#160;protected]</a>) before sending back your shirt. We will approve your exchange and email you back with specific instructions.</p>
                            <p>Your exchange will be processed after we receive your shirt in the mail. The replacement shirt can take up to a week to ship out.</p>
                            <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.</p>
                            <p>If you are shipping an item over $50, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</p>
                            <p><strong>Returns</strong><br />
                                We have a 30 day return policy. The 30 days starts the day the shirt is delivered to you, based on the USPS tracking. The shirt must be back to us by the 30th day.</p>
                            <p>Returns are accepted for any reason, but please give us a brief explanation as to why you’d like to return the item. We only allow refunds on items that are new and have not been worn, unless the product is somehow flawed.</p>
                            <p>*Please note that there are no returns accepted on custom items, clearance shirts or imperfection sales.</p>
                            <p>Please email us (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="33404643435c414773745c5247404756561d505c5e">[email&#160;protected]</a>) before returning an item. We will approve your return and email you back with specific return instructions.</p>
                            <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you are shipping an item over $50, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</p>
                            <p>You will be refunded the price of the item, minus our base shipping costs (even if you received free shipping originally). When your refund is processed a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment. For credit card refunds, it can take up to 3 days for the money to post to your account. If you have not seen a refund by the third day, please contact your bank first. If you still don’t see something, please let us know.</p>
                            <p><strong>Refunds on wrong address:</strong></p>
                            <p>It is your responsibility to supply a correct address. If your order is shipped to the wrong address and returned to our office, we can reship it to you for a $5 fee. If you don’t want to pay the fee, we can give you a refund for the order, minus the base shipping charge (even if you received free shipping originally).</p>
                            <p>*There will be a 10% cleaning fee for any shirts returned with pet hair or other markings</p>
                            <p>Holiday Season Refund/Exchange Policy<br />
                                *Active for orders placed November 1st – December 31st<br />
                                For Returns, we follow the same policy year round. Please refer to the Return Policy above for more information.</p>
                            <p>For Exchanges, we will allow a 60 day time frame rather than the normal 30 days. If 60 days have gone by from a purchase made between November 1st and December 31st, unfortunately we can’t offer you an exchange.</p>
                            <p>This is the only exception made for exchanges. All other information for exchanges can be found above.</p>
