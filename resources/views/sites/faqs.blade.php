                            <p><strong>Sizing Questions<br />
                                </strong></p>
                            <p>Q:Do you have a sizing chart?</p>
                            <p>A:Yes. You can view it <a href="https://Goatstee.com/size-chart">here</a>. There are instructions on how to measure a shirt you already own to see how you fit within our sizing. Since most of our tee shirts are 100% cotton, they will have a tendency to shrink about a size, so you may want to consider adding a size to your selection.</p>
                            <p>Q:I don’t understand your sizing chart.</p>
                            <p>A:If you take a look at the instructions at the top of our sizing page found here, there are instructions as to how to measure a shirt you already have to see how you would fit within our sizing chart. If you lay your shirt flat and measure as shown in the diagram, you should be able to find something very close on our chart that will work for you. Remember, the measurements in the chart are for the shirt, not the person that is meant to wear it.</p>
                            <p>Q:How do I know what my size is?</p>
                            <p>A:You can view our sizing chart. There are instructions on how to measure a shirt you already own to see how you fit within our sizing chart. Most of the feedback is that our unisex/guys tees are fairly true to size and the ladies tees run about a size smaller than normal. Tees are 100% cotton except for sports grey (90/10) and dark grey (50/50). Hoodies are 50/50 cotton poly, so they are usually more true to size.</p>

                            <p><strong>Shipping Questions<br />
                                </strong></p>
                            <p>Q:How long is it going to take?</p>
                            <p>A:Since we print shirts to order, and want to ensure that you receive the best quality possible, printing times can vary based on the current order volume. At this time most orders are shipping out between 1-3 days from the date of the order.</p>
                            <p>You will receive a shipping confirmation email at the address you provided which will contain either tracking information or a U.S. Customs number. USPS domestic usually takes 3-5 business days. UPS International can take 2-6 weeks.</p>
                            <p>Q:Do you ship to… And how much will it cost?</p>
                            <p>A:We ship to most countries throughout the world. The price is calculated based on your exact location and the weight of the package.</p>
                            <p>We use the UPS Mail Innovations to ship all orders and tracking will be available through them UPS.com. This tracking, however, only follows the package within the United States. After it departs the US Processing Center it becomes the property of that country’s postal system and they may be able to help you further. Currently we ship internationally with a rate per item of: $4.99 USD for each tee and $6.99 USD for each hoodie or sweat. Shipping times for international orders vary greatly, but we would recommend that you allow at least 2-4 weeks from the time it leaves the US for you to receive it. Many countries can be as quick as 7-10 days, although others may take as long as 6 weeks. For international deliveries as well, please note that any applicable import taxes or tariffs are the responsibility of the recipient and are not included in the original shipping cost.</p>

                            <p>Q:How long does printing usually take?</p>
                            <p>A:Since we print to order, printing times can vary. Currently we are printing mostly 1-3 day old orders, real time, although our typical guideline is to try to print and ship orders within 5 business days (1 week) of the time the order is placed. Thank you for your patience as we work to catch up. In any event, we will do our best to be as quick and efficient as possible in getting your shirt out to you.</p>
